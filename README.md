# OpenFOAM C++ Studies

This repository contains my studies and implementations within the OpenFOAM environment. These studies are inspired by Håkan Nilsson's work at Chalmers University and guided by various YouTube tutorials.


## Introduction

This repository contains my OpenFOAM C++ studies, focusing on advanced implementations of boundary conditions and modified solvers. Future updates will include new turbulence modelling, function objects, and more.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up your local copy of the project for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- OpenFOAM
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/openfoam-cpp-studies.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd openfoam-cpp-studies
    ```

3. Follow the specific setup instructions in each subdirectory's README.

## Files and Directories

- `boundaryConditions/` - Advanced implementation of boundary conditions.
- `Solvers/` - Modified solvers.
- More directories to be added soon...

## Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use the code can be found in each subdirectory's README. Here's a basic example to get you started:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    cd boundaryConditions
    ./Allwmake
    ```

2. Run the solver:

    ```bash
    cd ../modifiedSolvers
    ./runSolver
    ```

## Future Work

- Implementation of new turbulence modelling
- Development of function objects
- Additional OpenFOAM utilities and enhancements
